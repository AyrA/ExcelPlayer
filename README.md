Protection
----------
All files are protected. Not because I do want to hide my stuff, but to prevent accidental edits, as it voids the digital signature. If you want to have a look at the code or change the sheets, use **1234** as password for unlocking

ExcelPlayer
===========

This is an Excel sheet, that plays Video and Audio files you have the codec for. Useful if at work and you are monitored, as the playback (even the video window) counts as excel usage.

Utilizes macros.

How To
------
Open the File and confirm the security bar on top.
Go into the playlist sheet and add files. The easiest way to accomplish this, is to right click on a media file on your computer while holding shift. Select "copy as path" from the menu, than paste the path into excel. **For now, remove the quotes** of the file.
